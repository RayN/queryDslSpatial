# queryDslSpatial
Testing queryDsl for spatial queries

QueryDSL has good support for spatial queries but poor documentation.
That's why I shared this project.




# Running the project
1 - Clone the project
2 - Create a database named 'queryDslSpatial'. Or any other you like, just change application.properties
3 - Install postgis in the database: https://postgis.net/install/
4 - Start QueryDslSpatialTestApplication as a Spring Boot App. The tables and data will be inserted automatically using flyway
